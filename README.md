# AdViz

## Project Description 
AdViz is a simple web application that allows you to manage your contacts and visualize them on a map. You can decide whether a contact should be private or visible to everyone.

## Software Demo
You can [try AdViz here](http://34.91.249.158). 

Log in with one of the two test accounts:
- username: `admina`, password: `password`
- username: `normalo`, password: `password`

Admina can see, edit and delete all users' contacts (including private ones). Normalo can view, edit and delete his own contacts and view other people's public contacts. **Tip:** If the map doesn't load properly, open and close the developer tools once (CTRL + SHIFT + I on Chrome).
